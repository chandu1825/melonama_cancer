# Melanoma Detection System

This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit that utilizes a deep learning model to assist in the detection of melanoma from skin lesion images.

## Introduction

Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This application provides a preliminary classification of skin lesions as either benign or potentially malignant (melanoma) based on an uploaded image.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is for informational and educational purposes only and should **NOT** be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

## Features

* **Image Upload:** Users can upload JPG, JPEG, or PNG images of skin lesions.
* **Deep Learning Prediction:** Integrates a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model to classify the uploaded image.
* **Prediction Output:** Displays the predicted class (Benign or Malignant) and the model's confidence level.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive web application.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras (for the deep learning model)
* **Image Processing:** Pillow (PIL Fork)
* **Numerical Operations:** NumPy
* **Python 3.7+**
